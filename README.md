# Portfolio Website
## _Created by Connor Abernethy_

A portfolio project created using TypeScript, React, NextJS, and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Info

This project was originally created as part of an honors project within the Barrett Honors College at Arizona State
University. It was intended to aid in the learning of NextJS and TypeScript, while also serving as a professional
portfolio for my future job search after graduation. This website will constantly update as projects, experience, and certifications are gained.
